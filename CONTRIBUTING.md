# Contribution Guide

Please follow the flow below.

1. Create an issue

## Create an issue

- Be sure to check if an equivalent issue already exists.
- Please handle only one topic per issue.

## Create a Pull-Request

- Please complete the issue creation first.
- Draft before completion of operation check.
- Don't forget to write `fix #<Issue Index>` if there is an issue that you want to close at the same time as merge.

## Create categories

**When creating a category, please create an issue first.**
Follow the directory structure below when creating categories.
Unless there are special circumstances, it is okay to use the one generated by `zig init-exe` as it is.

```
.
├── build.zig
├── README.ja.md
├── README.md
└── src
    └── main.zig
```
- README.md
Create a document for your category. The template is [here](./templates/category/README.md).

- README.ja.md
This is the Japanese version of `README.md`. It is desirable to create it together, but if it is difficult, please create a pull-request with that fact attached.
The template is [here](./templates/category/README.md).
